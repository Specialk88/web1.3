  <h2> Gavin Lux </h2>
    <p>Scouting grades: Hit: 55 | Power: 50 | Run: 60 | Arm: 55 | Field: 50 | Overall: 55</p>
    <p>Lux developed fine baseball instincts growing up around the game as the nephew of Augie Schmidt, the No. 2 overall pick and Golden Spikes Award winner in 1982 and the longtime coach at NCAA Division III Carthage (Wis.). He became a first-rounder himself as a Wisconsin high schooler in 2016, signing for $2,314,500 as the 20th overall choice, but struggled mightily for most of his first full pro season. He rebounded in 2018, leading all Minor League shortstops in all three slash categories (.324/.399/.514), reaching Double-A at age 20 and batting .424 in the Texas League playoffs to lead Tulsa to the championship.</p>
    <p>Lux broke out offensively after getting stronger and using his legs more while adding more launch angle to his left-handed stroke. Those changes as well as his bat speed give him more power than most middle infielders. He's an advanced hitter who has controlled the strike zone well and made consistent contact throughout his pro career, even when he wasn't putting up big numbers.</p>
    <p>With his plus speed and savvy, Lux can steal bases and has the upside of a 20-20 player. He has the raw tools to play shortstop, including quickness, soft hands and solid arm strength, and he has gotten smoother at the position since turning pro. But he also has had issues with throwing accuracy, leading to 61 errors in 208 games at short in his first three seasons, so many scouts think he'll wind up at second base.</p>
